# career_fair_report
This web application is designed to streamline the process of generating career fair student engagement reports for USC Marshall undergraduate students. 
It automates the often time-consuming and error-prone task of creating these reports by utilizing Python for data manipulation and Flask for the front-end interface. 
With this application, you can reduce the time needed for generating reports from 2 days to just 30 seconds and eliminate errors that may occur during manual report generation.
